Summary
==========
When the client receives a URL and http type, it builds the appropriate request string and connects to the server. It then receives all content returned from the server and returns it to the caller in the form of an HTTPResponse object. It will parse out the response's code and body when building the response object. It complies with all of the assignment specs and should perform as expected. See the code comments in httpclient.py for more detailed comments.

Know Issues
==========
There are no known issues with my implementation, all features should function as expected.

Collaboration
